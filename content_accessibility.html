            <p>
                Making the content of the website accessible means to make the information on the website as understandable as
                possible, expanding abbreviations and acronyms (like expanding HTML to HyperText Markup Language), as well as
                refraining from using slang terms, slang acronyms (like idk and lol), and try to use words instead of symbols 
                where it makes sense (like instead of using 5-7, using five to seven).

            <h2>How this website is coded to be accessible</h2>
            <p>
                Coding a website to be more accessible means to use semantic HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>),
                allowing interactable elements to be controlled in multiple ways (like mouse and also keyboard controls), and also
                making sure that your website can be viewed on a range of browsers and devices.

            <section>
                <h2>Semantic HyperText Markup Language</h2>
            <p>
                Semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is using the correct <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                elements for their intended purpose as much as possible. An example of this is instead of marking up a button control using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element,
                using the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element makes more sense and requires less work to make the button control work.</p><p> If you
                make websites, you may use non-semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> way more than you realise.</p><p> Some examples
                on non-semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                elements. These elements don't have a specific use, and can be used for anything.</p><p> You may be using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                element to separate sections where the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements would make more sense to use to
                separate sections, or you may be using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element to arrange headers and footers
                where using the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements would make more sense.</p><p> If you consistently
                make sure that you use the correct elements for the job as much as possible, you will realise that it makes more sense to use the specific element
                than using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.

            <p>
                You can allow interactable elements to be controlled in multiple ways by using the <code>tabindex</code> attribute in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                or by using JavaScript to add keyboard controls or navigation.

            <p>
                You can also make sure that your website can be viewed on a range of devices and browsers by ensuring that you are using code
                that is supported by most browsers. To also make sure that your website can be viewed on a range of devices, you can test your website
                on a range of devices and also test your website on different browsers.

                <h2>Skip Navigation Links</h2>
            <p>
            People percieving your website, using a screen reader or similar technology, may not want to hear navigation links being read aloud.
            Accessible websites implement a skip navigation link. A skip navigation link (or skipnav) is a link placed before navigation links
            that allow the user to tab to the skipnav link first (press <code>Tab</code> until you navigate to the skipnav link to see the skipnav link pop out from the top-left of the page) and skip past the navigation
            to the main content of a website. It is fairly simple to add to a website and can allow people who don't want to hear the links read aloud
            to skip the links, allowing for a better user experience.
