                <h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) is a set of
            guidelines proposed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (<abbr>WAI</abbr>) which is an intitiative made by the 
            World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) to develop and improve accessiblilty online for people with all types of impairments.</p><p> <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>
            is a set of standards and guidelines for accessiblilty for web content for people with disabilities and who need
            to use assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to make web content more accessible to people.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> is split up into four categories that majorly affect
            how accessible websites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Percievable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Operable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Understandable</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Robust</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> has three levels of compliance with their gudelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level A</strong>: This level is the most basic level of compliance. It can still be very hard for people with disabilities to use Level A websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Level AA</strong>: This level is what most websites aim to be, including this one! Level AA ensures that the website is also in Level A compliance, as well as being mostly usable and understandable for people with disabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Level AAA</strong>: This level is the most optimal compliance. This means that the website with Level AAA complaince has mostly perfect accessibility to most people with disabilities. It is incredibly difficult to achieve this level of compliance.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Percievable</h2>
                <p>Making your website percievable means that anyone should be able to sense your website, usually through sight, sound,
                    or touch. This makes information easily accessible for people using assistive technologies (like screen readers).</p>
                    <p>Poor percievablility is like trying to read white text on a light gray background or muting a video and being unable
                    to follow the video with captions. This makes it hard for some people to see or understand your website.</p>
                    <p>Poor contrast (like background and foreground information are similar colours) and 
                    no text alternatives to multimedia (like images and videos) are examples of barriers to percievablility.</p>
                    <p>You can make your website percievable by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding alternate text to images, so they can be sensed without sight</li>
                        <li>Adding captions to videos, so they can be sensed without sound</li>
                        <li>Choosing colours for the background and foreground that contrast 
                            each other (like a bright colour for the foreground, and a dark colour for the background), so the foreground can be easily seen</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your website should be percievable so that anyone can sense your website, the layout, and the content.</p></section>

                <h2>Operable</h2>
                <p>Making your website operable means that anyone should be able to control or interact with your website.</p>
                <p>Poor operability is like trying to click a tiny button or trying to control a setting that is very hard to control.
                    This can make it hard for people to control you website, or might be impossible for some people.
                </p><p>You can make your website operable by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making links and buttons big enough to easily click or tap</li>
                    <li>Allowing your website to be controlled in a way other than only the mouse</li>
                    <li>Allowing the user to control all the features or controls your website provides, like pausing moving content</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your website should be operable, so anyone can interact with your website.</p></section>

                <section id="understandable_s">
                <h2>Understandable</h2>
                <p>Making your website understandable means to make your content easy to understand or follow and giving clear
                    instructions when needed.
                </p><p>Poor understandability is like seeing lots of technical words and acronyms that you don't know,
                    or seeing an error message that doesn't explain what the problem is.
                </p><p>You can make your website understandable by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplifying your content, by expanding acronyms or explaining technical words</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that navigating around is predictable, so people can navigate without problems</li>
                    <li>If there is an error, explain how it might have been caused, and provide some possible solutions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You website should be understandable, so users aren't stuck on your website.</p></section>

                <h2>Robust</h2>
                <p>Making your website robust means to make sure that your website can keep up with new technologies and standards,
                    and to make sure that your website can be accessed from any device that has a browser.</p>
                    <p>Poor robustness is like how the layout of a website gets all messed up because of how a different browsers
                        interpret the code, and a lack of support for assistive technologies like screen readers.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can make your website robust by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using code that is supported on a range of devices and is easy for assistive technologies to understand</li>
                        <li>Testing your website with different browsers and tools to see what your website supports and how to improve your website</li>
                        <li>Future-proofing your website, so it supports new technology when it comes out</li>
                    </ul><p>Your website should be robust, so it doesn't break after a browser or code update.</p></section>

                <p>By thinking about these four principles of the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines (Percievable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) when making a website, you can make your website easier to use for people with and without impairments!</p>
