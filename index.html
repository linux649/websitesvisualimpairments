            <h2>Visual Impairments</h2>
            <p>
                According to the World Health Organisation (<abbr>WHO</abbr>), there are around <strong>2.2 billion people globally</strong>
                who have a near or distance vision impairment. They estimate that <strong>everyone, if they live long enough, will
                develop at least one eye condition in their lifetime</strong>. The risk of developing a visual impairment increases
                depending on your age, whether you have genetics that can cause a visual impairment, your ethnic background,
                your lifestyle and the factors in your environment.</p><p> This is a large amount of people who can't potentially
                access or understand websites with poor accessiblilty coding.

            <h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) is a set of
            guidelines proposed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (<abbr>WAI</abbr>) which is an intitiative made by the 
            World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) to develop and improve accessiblilty online for people with all types of impairments. <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>
            is a set of standards and guidelines for accessiblilty for web content for people with disabilities and who need
            to use assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to make web content more accessible to people.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> is split up into four categories that majorly affect
            how accessible websites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Percievable</strong>: Users must be able to percieve the web content using one or more of their senses.</li>
                <li><strong>Operable</strong>: Users must be able to control interactable web elements in some way.</li>
                <li><strong>Understandable</strong>: Users must be able to understand the content.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust</strong>: The content must be developed using adopted web standards that will work on different browsers
                now and in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By following <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>, we can effectively improve our website to become more
            accessible along with making content more friendly to assistive technologies, like screen readers.</p>

                <h2>Making websites more accessible</h2>
                <p>
                We can make more accessible by making content more friendly to screen readers and other assistive technologies
                and using HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>) and Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr>CSS</abbr>) in a way to
                improve accessibility, and creating websites with accessibility in mind. We can also use <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> as a 
                set of standards and as a guide to further improve accessibililty on websites.
